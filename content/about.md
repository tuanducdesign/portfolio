# About Me

## Bio

Hey, I'm Ashal. A _self-taught_ Frontend Engineer in [OY! Indonesia](https://oyindonesia.com), where I help to build B2B Dashboard. I'm also contributed to bug fixing some open source project that I've been used.

## Education

I graduated from a Vocational High School in 2021, with Airframe and Power Plant Major.

## Journey

My journey started in an online learning platform, called [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). There I've learned about basic Web Development such as `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.

> And the rest of my learning phase was in some `internship` programs.
