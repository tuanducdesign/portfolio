# A brief about my career

Most of my experience as a Frontend Engineer is on the `Web` platform, but I'm also willing to learn about `Mobile` platform, I do learn some `Flutter` and `React Native`.

I really want to be a Frontend Architect, or actually, someone who works as the core of the `Web Application`, working for a tool or internal library that can be used by other developer/engineer.

I'm also in love with `Open Source Software`, contributed to the project that I'm often use for bugfix or improvements. Create a starter/boilerplate project like [this one](https://github.com/ashalfarhan/gridsome-starter-chakra-ui) and other stuff as well if I have time to work on it.

Sometimes in the weekend, I spend my time for exploring new technologies or new fields that I've never touch, like `Backend Development` and `Smart Contract` like [this project](https://github.com/ashalfarhan/learn-eth).

> Hope that you understand about my growth plan from here.
